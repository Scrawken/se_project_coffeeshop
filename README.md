# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop
This is the second project in the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. The goal of this project is to design and develop a responsive coffee shop website using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project Overview
The website is designed with a user-friendly interface, showcasing the essence of a cozy coffee shop. It uses modern web development techniques, including HTML5 and CSS, to create a visually appealing, functional, and responsive design.

## Project Features

- **Semantic HTML5**: Utilized for clear, meaningful document structure, making the code more readable and accessible.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Used to create flexible and responsive layouts that adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Positioning**: Applied to position elements precisely within the layout for a clean, organized design.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier) Methodology**: A structured, maintainable class naming convention that makes the code more modular and easier to scale.
- **Custom Form**: Includes a custom form for user interaction (e.g., newsletter sign-up or contact form).
- **CSS Animation & Transform**: Adds dynamic and interactive features such as hover effects and transitions for better user engagement.

## Plan on Improving the Project

- **Mobile-First Design**: Shift to a mobile-first approach to improve responsiveness and performance on smaller devices.
- **Enhanced CSS Animations & Transitions**: Further refine animations and transitions for a smoother and more polished user experience.
- **JavaScript for Interactivity**: Introduce JavaScript for dynamic functionality, such as a cart system or interactive menu.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing**: Ensure the site works seamlessly across various browsers to provide a consistent experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language for structuring content and ensuring semantic document structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling language for layout, design, animations, and responsive features.
- **Flexbox**: For creating responsive, flexible layouts.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: For maintainable and scalable class naming.
